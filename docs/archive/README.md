## Why These Were Archived

1. **Redundancy:** Multiple files covering the same topics created confusion
2. **Outdated:** Information superseded by more recent, comprehensive documentation
3. **Milestone Markers:** Historical markers that served their purpose but aren't needed for active development
4. **Consolidation:** Content merged into authoritative single-source documents
