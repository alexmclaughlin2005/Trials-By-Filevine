# Phase Completion Archive

**Purpose:** Historical phase completion documents and implementation plans.

**Archive Date:** January 31, 2026

---

## Contents

These files document the completion of various development phases. Each phase document typically includes:
- Features implemented
- Technical decisions
- Testing results
- Next steps (at time of writing)

## Files (9 total)

| Phase | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | `PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Signal system implementation |
| Phase 1 | `PHASE_1_SIGNAL_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` | Signal system completion marker |
| Phase 1 | `PHASE_1_TESTING_GUIDE.md` | Testing guide for Phase 1 |
| Phase 2 | `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Matching algorithms implementation |
| Phase 2 | `PHASE_2_MATCHING_ALGORITHMS_COMPLETE.md` | Matching algorithms completion |
| Phase 3 | `PHASE_3_QUESTION_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md` | Question generation complete |
| Phase 3 | `PHASE_3_UI_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | UI implementation complete |
| Phase 5 | `PHASE_5_DISSENT_ENGAGEMENT.md` | Dissent engagement design |
| Phase 5 | `PHASE_5_UX_ENHANCEMENTS_PLAN.md` | UX enhancements plan |

## Previously Archived (in parent archive/)

Additional phase documents were archived earlier:
- `PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE_2_README.md`
- `PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE_3_CASE_MANAGEMENT_UI.md`

## Still Active (not archived)

These phase documents remain at root level as they're still relevant:
- `PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md` - Document capture & OCR (recent feature)
- `PHASE_4_STAGNATION_DETECTION.md` - Active feature design
- `PHASE_5B_*.md` files - Current planning documents

## Why Archived

Phase completion documents become historical once:
1. The phase is fully complete and stable
2. Information has been consolidated into primary docs
3. No active development references them

## Current Status Reference

For current implementation status, see:
- [AI_instructions.md](../../../AI_instructions.md) - Implementation Status section
- [PROJECT_STATUS.md](../../../PROJECT_STATUS.md) - Phase completion overview
