## Previously Archived (in parent archive/)

Additional deployment documents were archived earlier:
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md`

## Still Active (not archived)

Primary deployment documentation remains at root:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - **Primary deployment reference**
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Railway-specific guide

## Why Archived

Deployment milestone documents are point-in-time snapshots. Once a deployment is successful and stable:
1. The milestone marker serves historical purposes only
2. Ongoing deployment instructions live in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
3. Specific feature deployments are documented in feature docs

## When to Reference

- Understanding deployment history
- Debugging production issues
- Auditing deployment timeline
- Referencing rollback procedures for specific features
