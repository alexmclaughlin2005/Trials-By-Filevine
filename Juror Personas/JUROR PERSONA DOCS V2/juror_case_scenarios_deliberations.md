# Case-Type Scenarios & Deliberation Scripts

## Additional Case-Type Scenarios

---

## Employment Retaliation / Wrongful Termination

### Case Profile
**Plaintiff:** Former warehouse supervisor, age 52
**Defendant:** National logistics company
**Allegation:** Terminated after reporting safety violations to OSHA; pretext given was "performance issues"

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | 30% | Low | "Did he actually have performance issues?" |
| **Crusader** | 90% | High + Punitive | "Classic retaliation—they punished a whistleblower" |
| **Scale-Balancer** | 60% | Moderate | "What's the timeline? Did the report cause the termination?" |
| **Heart** | 70% | Moderate-High | "He did the right thing and lost his job" |
| **Calculator** | 50% | Calculated | "What's the pattern of terminations? Statistical analysis?" |
| **Blue-Collar Crusader** | 95% | Very High | "I've seen this happen. Companies hate people who speak up." |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Plaintiff had never received negative performance review until after OSHA complaint"**
- Bootstrapper: "Maybe management finally noticed the issues"
- Crusader: "Textbook retaliation—they invented problems"
- Scale-Balancer: "Strong circumstantial evidence"

**"Company fired three other employees who complained about safety that year"**
- All archetypes: Pattern evidence is powerful
- Bootstrapper (softening): "That does look bad"
- Calculator: "Statistically significant?"

**"Plaintiff was sometimes late to work"**
- Bootstrapper: "See? There were real performance issues"
- Crusader: "So fire him for lateness, not after he reports safety issues"
- Scale-Balancer: "Was lateness ever mentioned before?"

### Regional Variations

| Region | Tendency | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Texas** | Mixed | Strong employer rights culture BUT also "underdog" sympathy |
| **California** | Pro-Plaintiff | Strong whistleblower protection culture |
| **Midwest** | Pro-Plaintiff | Union influence, worker solidarity |
| **Deep South** | Pro-Defense | Right-to-work culture, employer deference |

---

## Construction Site Accident

### Case Profile
**Plaintiff:** Carpenter who fell from scaffolding, now paraplegic
**Defendant:** General contractor, scaffolding subcontractor
**Allegation:** Defective scaffolding setup, failure to inspect, inadequate fall protection

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | 40% | Low-Moderate | "Construction is dangerous—he knew the risks" |
| **Crusader** | 85% | Maximum | "Companies cut corners to save money" |
| **Scale-Balancer** | 65% | Based on evidence | "Who set up the scaffolding? What were the inspection records?" |
| **Heart** | 80% | Very High | "He'll never walk again" |
| **Calculator** | 60% | Calculated life-care | "What's the life care plan cost? Future lost earnings?" |
| **Military PRE (Jose)** | 55% | Moderate | "If there were clear safety violations, that's unacceptable" |
| **Union Electrician (Jimmy)** | 85% | High | "I've seen contractors skip safety to save money" |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Scaffolding was missing guardrails required by OSHA"**
- Bootstrapper: "But he could have refused to go up"
- Crusader: "Clear violation. They chose to save money."
- Scale-Balancer: "Significant regulatory violation"
- Military PRE: "Standards exist for a reason. This is on them."

**"Plaintiff wasn't wearing his harness"**
- Bootstrapper: "There it is. Personal responsibility."
- Crusader: "Were harnesses even provided? Was there anchor point?"
- Scale-Balancer: "Contributory negligence, but doesn't excuse missing guardrails"

**"OSHA had cited this contractor twice before for fall protection violations"**
- Most archetypes: Pattern evidence is compelling
- Bootstrapper (shifting): "Okay, this is a pattern. That changes things."

### Damages Discussion (Catastrophic Injury)

This case involves catastrophic damages. Key archetype reactions to life care plan showing $8M in future medical/care needs:

| Archetype | Reaction to $8M Life Care Plan |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | "That's a lot of money. Is all of this really necessary?" |
| **Crusader** | "He needs every bit of this. His life is destroyed." |
| **Scale-Balancer** | "Let's go through line by line. What's reasonable?" |
| **Heart** | "Imagine needing help with everything for the rest of your life" |
| **Calculator** | "I want to verify these assumptions—life expectancy, care costs per year" |

---

## Defective Drug / Pharmaceutical

### Case Profile
**Plaintiff:** Patient who suffered heart attack allegedly from blood pressure medication
**Defendant:** Pharmaceutical company
**Allegation:** Drug had undisclosed cardiac risks; company knew from clinical trials but minimized in labeling

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | 35% | Low | "All drugs have side effects. Did he read the warnings?" |
| **Crusader** | 90% | Maximum + Punitive | "Big Pharma hides dangers to make money" |
| **Scale-Balancer** | 60% | Moderate-High | "What did the clinical trials show? Was labeling adequate?" |
| **Heart** | 75% | High | "He trusted his doctor and this medication" |
| **Calculator** | 55% | Calculated | "What's the relative risk increase? Statistically significant?" |
| **Doctor's Daughter Diana** | 20% | Very Low | "All medications have risks. Patients need to be informed." |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Internal memo: 'Cardiac signal in trial data—recommend not highlighting in label'"**
- Bootstrapper: "That does look bad"
- Crusader: "They knew! They deliberately hid it!"
- Calculator: "What was the relative risk ratio? Was it statistically significant?"

**"FDA approved the drug and labeling"**
- Bootstrapper: "Government approved it—that should mean something"
- Crusader: "FDA is captured by industry. They only see what companies show them."
- Scale-Balancer: "FDA approval is one factor, but companies can still withhold information"

**"Plaintiff didn't tell doctor about family history of heart disease"**
- Bootstrapper: "There it is. Doctor can't know what patient doesn't share."
- Crusader: "Drug shouldn't cause heart attacks regardless"
- Scale-Balancer: "Relevant to causation—would prescription have changed?"

### Special Note: Causation Challenges
Pharmaceutical cases often hinge on causation. Calculator types will focus heavily on statistical evidence. Crusader types may accept weaker causation evidence if "company knew" narrative is strong.

## Birth Injury / Obstetric Malpractice

### Case Profile
**Plaintiff:** Parents of child born with cerebral palsy
**Defendant:** Obstetrician, hospital
**Allegation:** Failure to recognize fetal distress, delayed C-section

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | 30% | Moderate | "Childbirth is unpredictable. Were there warning signs?" |
| **Crusader** | 70% | Very High | "Baby was injured because doctors didn't act fast enough" |
| **Scale-Balancer** | 55% | High if liability found | "What did the fetal monitoring show? When did distress begin?" |
| **Heart** | 85% | Maximum | "That child will suffer their entire life" |
| **Calculator** | 50% | Life-care calculated | "What was timing of distress vs. delivery? Causation window?" |
| **Young Mother (Ashley)** | 90% | Very High | "That could have been my baby" |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Fetal heart rate showed decelerations for 30 minutes before C-section was called"**
- Bootstrapper: "What's normal? I don't know how to read these strips"
- Crusader: "30 minutes of distress before acting!"
- Calculator: "What's the standard for intervention? What does literature say?"

**"Defense expert: 'Cerebral palsy often occurs before labor even begins'"**
- Bootstrapper: "So maybe it wasn't the delivery at all"
- Crusader: "Hired gun defending bad doctors"
- Scale-Balancer: "What does the timing evidence show?"

### Emotional Weight
Birth injury cases are emotionally powerful. Hearts will be strongly moved. Even Bootstrappers may be affected when child is present in courtroom. This case type often produces higher damages than case merit suggests due to emotional weight.

---

## Sexual Abuse Institutional Liability

### Case Profile
**Plaintiff:** Adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse at youth sports organization
**Defendant:** National youth sports organization
**Allegation:** Organization failed to screen coaches, ignored prior complaints, covered up abuse

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | 60% | Moderate-High | Usually anti-lawsuit, BUT child protection is special |
| **Crusader** | 95% | Maximum + Punitive | "Institutions protect themselves, not children" |
| **Scale-Balancer** | 75% | High | "What did the organization know? What protocols existed?" |
| **Heart** | 95% | Very High | "That child's innocence was stolen" |
| **Calculator** | 65% | Challenging to calculate | "How do we quantify psychological harm?" |
| **Sunday-School Sandra** | 90% | High | "Jesus said whoever harms these little ones..." |

### Special Dynamic: Child Abuse Exception
Even strong Bootstrappers often shift in child abuse cases. The "personal responsibility" frame doesn't apply to children. Religious Bootstrappers may be especially moved—child protection is a near-universal value.

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Organization had received two prior complaints about this coach"**
- All archetypes: This is devastating evidence
- Bootstrapper: "They knew and did nothing? That's different."
- Crusader: "They chose to protect themselves instead of children"

**"Organization didn't require background checks until 2015"**
- Bootstrapper: "What was standard practice at the time?"
- Crusader: "They should have been ahead of the curve, not behind"
- Scale-Balancer: "What did other organizations do?"

## Automotive Product Defect

### Case Profile
**Plaintiff:** Family of driver killed when SUV rolled over
**Defendant:** Auto manufacturer
**Allegation:** Vehicle had design defect making it prone to rollover; roof crushed in rollover

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Bootstrapper** | 40% | Low-Moderate | "How was he driving? Was he speeding? Swerving?" |
| **Crusader** | 90% | Maximum + Punitive | "Automakers know about defects and calculate death settlements into cost" |
| **Scale-Balancer** | 65% | Moderate-High | "What's the rollover rate vs. comparable vehicles? What did crash testing show?" |
| **Heart** | 85% | High | "His children don't have a father" |
| **Calculator** | 60% | Calculated | "What's the statistical significance of the rollover rate?" |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Internal document: 'Roof strength could be increased for $15/vehicle but not cost-justified'"**
- Bootstrapper: "Business decision... but $15?"
- Crusader: "They calculated lives vs. dollars and chose dollars!"
- Calculator: "What was the assumed reduction in deaths? What was implied value of life?"

**"Driver was going 10 mph over speed limit"**
- Bootstrapper: "Contributing factor"
- Crusader: "Car shouldn't crush you for going 10 over"
- Scale-Balancer: "Would roof have crushed at speed limit? What do tests show?"

### Ford Pinto Effect
"Cost-benefit analysis" documents are devastating in product liability. They activate even Bootstrappers' sense of justice. The "they knew the cost to save lives and chose not to" narrative is powerful across archetypes.

# DETAILED DELIBERATION SCRIPTS

## Script 1: Trucking Accident - Divided Jury

### Jury Composition
- 2 Bootstrappers: "Bootstrap Bob" (foreman candidate), "Farm-Raised Francine"
- 2 Crusaders: "Union-Strong Ulysses," "Teacher-Activist Tanya"
- 4 Scale-Balancers: "Librarian Linda," "Engineer Eric," "Auditor Adam," "Moderate Mike"
- 2 Hearts: "Counselor Carmen," "Caregiver Carol"
- 2 Chameleons: "Go-Along Gail," "First-Timer Frank"

### Case Summary
Truck driver ran red light and killed car driver. Evidence shows trucker had falsified logs and was on hour 15 of driving. Trucking company had pattern of pressuring drivers on delivery times. Plaintiff (widow) requests $4M total ($500K economic, $3.5M non-economic/loss of consortium).

---

### Opening - Foreperson Selection

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Well, someone needs to run this thing. I managed teams for 30 years. I'm happy to organize our discussion if nobody else wants to."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** [Thinks: I don't want him controlling this] "I've run plenty of meetings myself. Maybe we should take a vote."

**Librarian Linda:** "Why don't we just see how the discussion goes? We don't necessarily need a formal foreperson right away."

**Engineer Eric:** "I agree with Linda. Let's start with the evidence and see if someone naturally emerges as a facilitator."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Fair enough. So where do we start?"

---

### First Issue - Liability

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Let me throw this out there. The truck driver ran a red light. That seems pretty clear. But the company—are they really responsible for what their driver did? He's the one who chose to falsify his logs."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "Bob, I've worked with truckers my whole career through the union. These companies pressure drivers constantly. 'Make this delivery or you're fired.' The driver is following orders."

**Farm-Raised Francine:** "But nobody put a gun to his head. He could have refused."

**Teacher-Activist Tanya:** "And lost his job? His family? The company created the situation. They're the ones with the power."

**Engineer Eric:** "Let me ask a factual question. What does the evidence show about the company's delivery expectations? Were they unrealistic?"

**Librarian Linda:** [Pulls out notes] "The plaintiff's evidence showed the delivery schedule required the driver to exceed hours-of-service limits to make the deadline. The company dispatcher's messages showed language like 'I don't care how you do it, just get there.'"

**Auditor Adam:** "And the company's own records showed they'd had multiple hours-of-service violations that year. That's a pattern."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "A pattern of violations is concerning, I'll grant you that. But the driver still had a choice."

**Counselor Carmen:** "Can we step back for a moment? A woman lost her husband. Three children lost their father. Because a company decided their delivery schedule mattered more than a driver being awake."

**Farm-Raised Francine:** "I feel for the family, I do. But sympathy isn't evidence."

**Moderate Mike:** "I think we need to separate two questions. First: was the driver at fault? That seems clear—he ran a red light. Second: is the company also responsible? That's where I'm hearing disagreement."

**Engineer Eric:** "In engineering, when there's a system failure, we look at root causes. The immediate cause was the driver running the light. The root cause was fatigue. The systemic cause was a company policy that made fatigue inevitable. All three levels bear responsibility."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "That's an interesting way to look at it."

**Librarian Linda:** "I think the judge's instructions said we can find multiple parties responsible and apportion fault. So we don't have to choose—we can say the driver was 30% at fault and the company 70%, or whatever the evidence supports."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "I'd say the company is at least 80% responsible. They created the conditions."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "And I'd say 50-50 at most. The driver still made the choice."

**Go-Along Gail:** [Has been silent] "I can see both sides..."

**Moderate Mike:** "Why don't we see if we can agree on a range and narrow it down? Does everyone agree the company has SOME responsibility?"

[General nods around the room]

**Moderate Mike:** "And does everyone agree the driver has SOME responsibility?"

**Teacher-Activist Tanya:** "I guess... even though the system made it almost impossible for him to do the right thing."

**Moderate Mike:** "So we're somewhere between 50-50 and 90-10 company. Let's discuss further."

---

### Moving Toward Consensus on Liability

**After further discussion...**

**Librarian Linda:** "Based on everything I've heard, I think 70-30 company/driver makes sense. The company created the conditions, but the driver still chose to falsify logs rather than report the problem."

**Engineer Eric:** "I can support that."

**Auditor Adam:** "Same. The pattern of violations tips it toward company responsibility."

**Caregiver Carol:** "I think the company deserves more blame, but I can live with 70-30 to reach a verdict."

**Counselor Carmen:** "Agreed."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "I still think it should be higher, but 70-30 is close enough."

**Teacher-Activist Tanya:** "Fine."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "That's more than I think the company deserves, but... the pattern evidence does bother me. 70-30 it is."

**Farm-Raised Francine:** "If Bob can live with it, I suppose I can too."

**Go-Along Gail:** "Yes, that sounds right."

**First-Timer Frank:** "I agree with everyone."

**Moderate Mike:** "That's unanimous on liability at 70-30. Now we need to discuss damages."

---

### Damages Discussion - The Hard Part

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Here's where I think we need to be careful. The widow is asking for $4 million. That's... a lot of money."

**Counselor Carmen:** "For losing her husband? For her children never seeing their father again?"

**Bootstrap Bob:** "I'm not saying he was worthless. But $3.5 million for 'non-economic' damages? What does that even mean?"

**Auditor Adam:** "Let me break down the economic damages first. Lost wages: the husband was 38, earning $75,000, with a work life expectancy of another 27 years. Their economist calculated $1.8 million in present value, but the plaintiff is only asking for $500,000. That seems conservative."

**Engineer Eric:** "I noticed that too. They're actually underasking on the economic side."

**Farm-Raised Francine:** "Well, $500,000 sounds reasonable for the lost income then."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "The economic piece is easy. Let's talk about what the company owes this family for destroying their lives."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "I knew you'd go big on this."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "Bob, imagine if this was your wife. Your kids. You get a call that your spouse was killed because a company pushed a driver past his limits to save money on delivery schedules. What's that worth?"

**Bootstrap Bob:** [Pauses] "I... it's terrible. I know that."

**Librarian Linda:** "The judge said we should consider loss of companionship, loss of consortium, grief, that kind of thing. Those are real harms."

**Caregiver Carol:** "When my mother was sick, I learned how much just having someone there matters. This family had that taken away permanently."

**Counselor Carmen:** "Children who lose parents have higher rates of depression, anxiety, worse educational outcomes. The research is clear. The harm ripples out for generations."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "I understand the harm is real. I'm just not sure how you put a number on it."

**Moderate Mike:** "Maybe we should think about what range feels appropriate and see where we land. Is everyone comfortable with something above $500,000 for non-economic?"

[Nods around the room]

**Moderate Mike:** "Is everyone comfortable with something below the $3.5 million requested?"

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "I'm not. I think the full amount is justified."

**Teacher-Activist Tanya:** "I agree with Ulysses."

**Counselor Carmen:** "I think somewhere around $2-2.5 million feels right to me."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "I was thinking more like $1 million. Combined with the $500K economic, that's $1.5 million total. That's a lot of money."

**Librarian Linda:** "Bob, can I share something? I looked at other verdict amounts during the trial when the lawyers mentioned them. For wrongful death of a working-age parent, verdicts in this range seem to be $1.5-3 million for non-economic damages. We're in a normal range."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Really? That's typical?"

**Auditor Adam:** "The numbers I heard were similar. We're not talking about an unusual amount."

**Farm-Raised Francine:** "If that's what other juries have awarded in similar situations..."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Alright. I'm not going to $3.5 million. But maybe I can move to $1.5 million on non-economic."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "That's still too low. Meet us at $2 million."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "Split the difference? $1.75 million?"

**Counselor Carmen:** "I could accept that."

**Librarian Linda:** "That brings us to $2.25 million total before we apply the 70-30 split."

**Engineer Eric:** "Wait—do we apply the fault percentage to the damages?"

**Librarian Linda:** "The judge's instructions said... let me find it... we award the full amount and the court reduces it based on the driver's fault."

**Moderate Mike:** "So our verdict would be $2.25 million, and the defendant company would pay 70% of that, which is about $1.575 million?"

**Auditor Adam:** "Actually, I think we just return the total amount and let the court figure out the reduction."

**Librarian Linda:** "That's my understanding too."

**Union-Strong Ulysses:** "So we're at $500K economic plus $1.75 million non-economic, total $2.25 million?"

**Go-Along Gail:** "That sounds fair."

**First-Timer Frank:** "I agree."

**Teacher-Activist Tanya:** "I still think it should be higher, but... okay. For a verdict."

**Bootstrap Bob:** "It's more than I wanted, but... alright. I can sign off on that."

**Farm-Raised Francine:** "Me too."

**Moderate Mike:** "Does anyone object to $2.25 million total damages?"

[Silence]

**Moderate Mike:** "Then we have a verdict. Liability 70% company, 30% driver. Damages $2.25 million."

## Script 2: Medical Malpractice - Defense Holdout

### Jury Composition
- 1 Defense Holdout: "Doctor's-Daughter Diana"
- 2 Crusaders: "Nurse Advocate Nadine," "Social-Justice Sarah"
- 4 Scale-Balancers: "Evidence-First Emily," "Principal Paula," "Mediator Maria," "Veteran Vince"
- 2 Hearts: "Father Feeling," "Sunday-School Sandra"
- 2 Chameleons: "Nervous Nellie," "Quiet Quentin"
- 1 Calculator: "Engineer Eduardo"

### Case Summary
Patient died from undiagnosed heart attack. Came to ER with chest pain, sent home with "acid reflux" diagnosis. Died at home 8 hours later. Plaintiff (surviving spouse) alleges ER doctor failed to follow chest pain protocol.

---

### Critical Moment - Diana's Holdout

**After initial discussion, 11 jurors favor plaintiff. Diana is alone.**

**Nurse Advocate Nadine:** "I don't understand your position, Diana. The chest pain protocol was clear. The doctor didn't follow it. A man died."

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "You're all seeing this as if the doctor deliberately killed this man. Emergency rooms are chaos. Doctors see dozens of patients a night. They have to make judgment calls."

**Father Feeling:** "But the protocol exists precisely because these judgment calls can be wrong. The protocol is the safeguard."

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "My father was an ER doctor for 30 years. He saved thousands of lives. And he was sued twice by people looking for a payday. It nearly destroyed him."

**Social-Justice Sarah:** "I'm sorry that happened to your father, but this isn't about him. This is about this patient, this doctor, this case."

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "The plaintiff's lawyers want you to think medicine is simple. It's not. Chest pain can be a hundred different things."

**Engineer Eduardo:** "Diana, I've tried to look at this objectively. The protocol says: chest pain plus these risk factors equals cardiac workup. This patient had chest pain plus three risk factors. No cardiac workup was done. That seems like a clear deviation from the protocol."

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "Protocols are guidelines, not absolute rules. Doctors have to use clinical judgment."

**Nurse Advocate Nadine:** "Diana, I've worked in hospitals for 25 years. When a doctor deviates from protocol, they're supposed to document why. Did this doctor document any reason for not following the chest pain protocol?"

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** [Pauses] "No."

**Nurse Advocate Nadine:** "So he didn't follow the protocol AND didn't explain why. That's not clinical judgment. That's a miss."

**Evidence-First Emily:** "Diana, I want to understand your position. Is there any evidence that would change your mind? Or is your position that no ER malpractice case should ever succeed?"

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "That's not... I just think we hold doctors to an impossible standard."

**Mediator Maria:** "Let me try something. Diana, if this exact case happened to someone in your family—if your husband went to the ER with chest pain, was sent home, and died—would you think the doctor made a mistake?"

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** [Long pause] "...maybe."

**Sunday-School Sandra:** "A man's wife is out there, alone now. She trusted the hospital to help her husband. They didn't."

**Veteran Vince:** "Diana, I respect doctors. I owe my life to military medics and VA doctors. But accountability matters. If a soldier makes a mistake that gets someone killed, there are consequences. Same should apply to doctors."

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "You're all ganging up on me."

**Principal Paula:** "We're not ganging up. We're trying to understand. You're the only one who sees this differently, and we want to know what you're seeing that we're not."

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "I just... I know how hard these jobs are."

**Father Feeling:** "Diana, the question isn't whether being an ER doctor is hard. It is. The question is whether this specific doctor, in this specific case, fell below the standard of care. Eleven of us think the evidence shows he did. What would you need to see to agree?"

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "I would need to believe the doctor was genuinely negligent, not just that something bad happened."

**Nurse Advocate Nadine:** "Diana, three risk factors. No EKG. No cardiac enzymes. No explanation in the chart. What does negligence look like if not that?"

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** [Very long pause] "...I don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm too close to this because of my father."

**Evidence-First Emily:** "Can you vote with us on liability, even if you have reservations about damages?"

**Doctor's-Daughter Diana:** "I... yes. I can see the protocol wasn't followed. I'll agree on liability. But I want to talk about damages because I don't think we should give the plaintiff everything they're asking for."

**Mediator Maria:** "That's fair. Let's have that discussion."

## Script 3: Product Liability - Calculator Drives Damages Down

### Jury Composition
- 2 Calculators: "Data-Driven David" (influential), "Accountant Alice"
- 2 Crusaders: "Environmental Emma," "Gig-Economy Greg"
- 3 Scale-Balancers: "Auditor Adam," "Librarian Linda," "Engineer Eric"
- 2 Hearts: "Hospice Helen," "Momma Meredith"
- 2 Bootstrappers: "No-Excuses Nancy," "Moderate Mike" (leans PRE)
- 1 Chameleon: "Go-Along Gail"

### Case Summary
Plaintiff severely burned by exploding e-cigarette battery. Manufacturer knew of defect risk, did recall competitors' products but not their own. Plaintiff requesting $800K economic (medical bills, lost wages) + $3M non-economic + $5M punitive.

**Jury has agreed on liability. Now discussing damages.**

---

### Damages Deliberation

**Environmental Emma:** "They knew. They knew about the defect and they did nothing. The punitive damages have to send a message. $5 million is appropriate."

**Data-Driven David:** "Let me push back on that. Punitive damages should be proportional to harm and to the company's finances. What do we know about this company's revenue?"

**Librarian Linda:** "The evidence showed annual revenue of about $50 million."

**Data-Driven David:** "So $5 million in punitive damages is 10% of annual revenue. That's actually a significant hit. I'm not saying zero punitive, but we should be thoughtful about the number."

**Hospice Helen:** "That man's life is destroyed. He can't work. He can barely leave his house because of how he looks. What's that worth?"

**Accountant Alice:** "The economic damages are straightforward. Medical bills were $400,000. Lost wages over his remaining work life, given his injury, are about $350,000 present value. Call it $800K total economic. That's well-supported."

**No-Excuses Nancy:** "I can agree with the economic damages. It's the other stuff I have questions about."

**Data-Driven David:** "Let's think about the non-economic damages systematically. The plaintiff is 35. He has maybe 45-50 years of life expectancy. $3 million in non-economic damages is about $60-65K per year of suffering. Is that reasonable?"

**Gig-Economy Greg:** "You can't just divide it like that. Some of this suffering is now—the surgeries, the rehab. Some is forever—the scars, the stares."

**Momma Meredith:** "Did you see the pictures? He has burns over 30% of his body. His face... his own children were scared of him at first."

**Engineer Eric:** "I think David's analysis is helpful as a sanity check, though. $60K per year of additional suffering isn't an unreasonable way to think about it."

**Environmental Emma:** "You're trying to reduce this to math. Some things can't be calculated."

**Data-Driven David:** "Everything in a damages award is math, ultimately. We're literally putting a number on it. I'm just trying to make sure the number is rational."

**Librarian Linda:** "What if we approach it differently? What would each of us individually award for non-economic damages? Then we can see where we are."

**Data-Driven David:** "I'd say $1.5 million."

**Accountant Alice:** "I'm around there too. $1.5 to $2 million."

**Environmental Emma:** "The full $3 million, plus more if we could."

**Hospice Helen:** "$3 million seems right."

**Momma Meredith:** "$2.5 million."

**No-Excuses Nancy:** "$1 million."

**Gig-Economy Greg:** "$3 million."

**Auditor Adam:** "$2 million."

**Librarian Linda:** "$2 million."

**Engineer Eric:** "$1.8 million."

**Moderate Mike:** "$1.5 million."

**Go-Along Gail:** "I... I don't know. Maybe $2 million? Is that what most people think?"

**Librarian Linda:** "So we have a range from $1 million to $3 million, with most people clustered around $1.5-2.5 million. The average is about $2 million."

**Data-Driven David:** "I could move to $2 million if that gets us to consensus."

**Environmental Emma:** "That's a million less than he asked for."

**Hospice Helen:** "But it's still a significant amount. And we haven't talked about punitive yet."

**No-Excuses Nancy:** "If we're doing $2 million on non-economic, I want to see the punitive stay reasonable."

**Data-Driven David:** "What about 1:1 ratio? $2 million punitive to match the non-economic. Total award would be $800K + $2M + $2M = $4.8 million."

**Environmental Emma:** "That's not enough to deter a company that makes $50 million a year."

**Auditor Adam:** "Actually, $4.8 million total is almost 10% of their annual revenue. That's a significant judgment. It will absolutely get their attention."

**Gig-Economy Greg:** "Will it though? Or will they just raise prices and keep doing what they're doing?"

**Data-Driven David:** "There's some research showing that punitive damages beyond a certain ratio don't have additional deterrent effect. The fact that there ARE punitive damages sends the message."

**Librarian Linda:** "Are we all comfortable with $4.8 million total? $800K economic, $2M non-economic, $2M punitive?"

**Environmental Emma:** "I still think it should be higher."

**Moderate Mike:** "And I think it's a bit high. But $4.8 million is in a reasonable range."

**Go-Along Gail:** "I can agree with that."

**Engineer Eric:** "I'm comfortable with it."

**Hospice Helen:** "I wish it were more, but... okay."

**No-Excuses Nancy:** "It's more than I wanted, but fine."

**Librarian Linda:** "We have consensus at $4.8 million total?"

[General agreement]
