## Opening (2 minutes)

### The Problem

**Script:**
> "In a high-stakes trial, jury selection can determine the outcome. But the current process is broken."
>
> *[Click to show statistics slide]*
>
> "Trial attorneys spend 15-30 minutes analyzing each juror manually. For a panel of 100 potential jurors, that's 25-50 hours of work. And even then, decisions are based on gut feeling and limited information."
>
> *[Click to show cost slide]*
>
> "Traditional focus groups cost $10,000-$15,000 and take 2-4 weeks. Most firms can only afford to test one or two arguments before trial."
>
> "The result? Attorneys go to trial with incomplete juror insights and untested arguments. They're essentially guessing."

### The Solution

**Script:**
> "TrialForge AI changes everything. We use Claude 4.5 - the most advanced AI model - to provide instant, data-driven insights for trial preparation."
>
> *[Click to show platform screenshot]*
>
> "Let me show you how it works with a real case."

## Live Demo (10 minutes)

### Part 1: The Case (30 seconds)

**Script:**
> "This is Johnson v. TechCorp - an age discrimination case. The plaintiff claims wrongful termination at age 45 when the company hired younger engineers."
>
> *[Show case overview page]*
>
> "We have 5 potential jurors on our jury panel. Let's see how TrialForge AI helps us analyze them."

### Part 2: AI Persona Analysis (2 minutes)

**Script:**
> "Meet Michael Chen, a 42-year-old software engineer. In traditional jury consulting, we'd spend 20-30 minutes reviewing his background, questionnaire, and any research we could find."
>
> *[Navigate to Michael Chen's profile]*
>
> "With TrialForge AI, watch this..."
>
> *[Click "Analyze with AI"]*
>
> "In just 5 seconds, our AI has analyzed his occupation, demographics, education, and questionnaire responses against our database of behavioral personas."
>
> *[Point to top match]*
>
> "Top match: Tech Pragmatist with 85% confidence. The AI tells us exactly why this match is strong..."
>
> *[Read key match points]*
>
> "And it even warns us about potential concerns..."
>
> *[Read concerns]*
>
> "This is actionable intelligence. We now know Michael likely values data over emotion, appreciates technical evidence, and may be skeptical of purely emotional appeals. That changes how we question him and how we present our case."
>
> **Key Point:**
> "Time saved: 20 minutes becomes 5 seconds. That's a 99.6% time reduction, and we can do this for 100 jurors in minutes."

### Part 3: Research Artifact Analysis (2 minutes)

**Script:**
> "Now let's say our paralegal found Michael's LinkedIn profile and some social media posts. Traditionally, someone would read through all of this and take notes."
>
> *[Show research artifacts]*
>
> "TrialForge AI can extract structured insights from any research artifact."
>
> *[Click "Analyze Research"]*
>
> "In 8 seconds, it's identified persona signals, extracted key themes, pulled relevant quotes, and even flagged the overall sentiment."
>
> *[Point to persona signal example]*
>
> "Look at this: 'Collaborative Decision Making' with 75% confidence, backed by specific evidence from his profile. This tells us he may value consensus in deliberations."
>
> **Key Point:**
> "Every insight is backed by evidence. We're not guessing - we're using AI to systematically extract patterns humans might miss."

### Part 4: Strategic Question Generation (2.5 minutes)

**Script:**
> "Now for voir dire preparation. Attorneys typically spend 4-8 hours crafting strategic questions for each case."
>
> *[Navigate to case, switch to Questions tab]*
>
> "Watch how fast TrialForge AI can do this..."
>
> *[Click "Generate Questions"]*
>
> "10 seconds. It's analyzing our case facts, the key issue of age discrimination, our target personas, and California jurisdiction rules."
>
> *[Show generated questions]*
>
> "It's created 23 questions organized into 4 strategic categories. Let me show you one high-priority question..."
>
> *[Expand a Priority 9 question]*
>
> "See how detailed this is? The question itself, the strategic purpose, which personas it targets, what to listen for in responses, red flags that indicate bias, ideal answers we want to hear, and even follow-up questions based on different responses."
>
> *[Point to follow-ups]*
>
> "It's like having a jury consultant whispering in your ear during voir dire."
>
> **Key Point:**
> "We've taken 8 hours of work and compressed it into 10 seconds. That's $2,000-$4,000 in attorney time saved per case."

### Part 5: Focus Group Simulation (3 minutes)

**Script:**
> "Finally, let's test our opening statement. Traditionally, you'd pay $10,000-$15,000 for a focus group and wait 2-4 weeks."
>
> *[Switch to Focus Groups tab]*
>
> "With TrialForge AI, we can simulate a 6-person jury panel representing diverse personas."
>
> *[Select opening statement argument]*
>
> "I'm selecting 'Detailed' mode, which gives us comprehensive feedback. There's also Quick mode for rapid testing and Deliberation mode that simulates the actual jury discussion."
>
> *[Click "Run Simulation"]*
>
> "12 seconds... and here are our results."
>
> *[Show overall reception]*
>
> "Average sentiment of +0.35 - generally favorable but room for improvement."
>
> *[Scroll to Tech Pragmatist reaction]*
>
> "Look at how our Tech Pragmatist persona responds. Remember Michael Chen? This tells us how jurors like him will likely react."
>
> "He likes the timeline and documentation references - that's the data-driven approach he values. But he wants more quantitative evidence and finds the emotional appeal less compelling."
>
> *[Scroll to recommendations]*
>
> "And here are prioritized recommendations. The top suggestion: add statistical evidence about hiring patterns. This would strengthen our case for Tech Pragmatist jurors."
>
> *[Show strengths/weaknesses cards]*
>
> "Clear summary of what's working and what needs work."
>
> **Key Points:**
> "Cost: $10,000 becomes 50 cents. Time: 3 weeks becomes 12 seconds. And we can test unlimited variations."
>
> "Imagine testing 10 different versions of your opening statement before trial. That's now possible."

## Business Impact (2 minutes)

### The Numbers

**Script:**
> "Let's talk about what this means for a law firm."
>
> *[Show business metrics slide]*
>
> "For a typical trial with 100 potential jurors and 5 arguments to test:"
>
> **Traditional Approach:**
> - Juror analysis: 40 hours @ $300/hour = $12,000
> - Focus groups: 3 sessions × $12,000 = $36,000
> - Total: $48,000
> - Timeline: 3-4 weeks
>
> **TrialForge AI:**
> - Juror analysis: 10 minutes @ $50 in AI costs = $50
> - Focus groups: 5 simulations @ $0.50 = $2.50
> - Total: $52.50
> - Timeline: 30 minutes
>
> "That's a 99.9% cost reduction and we've compressed 4 weeks into 30 minutes."

### Market Opportunity

**Script:**
> "There are 1.3 million attorneys in the US. 100,000+ trial attorneys. If even 10% adopt AI-assisted trial prep at $500/month, that's a $60M annual market."
>
> "But more importantly, this fundamentally changes how trials are prepared. We're making sophisticated jury consulting accessible to every attorney, not just large firms."

### Competitive Moat

**Script:**
> "Why us?
> - We use Claude 4.5 - the best AI model available
> - Our persona framework is based on validated psychology
> - We're integrated with Filevine's existing legal software
> - We have explainable AI - every decision shows its reasoning
> - SOC 2 compliance path built-in
>
> "This isn't just AI for AI's sake. This is purpose-built intelligence for trial preparation."

## Closing (1 minute)

### The Vision

**Script:**
> "We're not trying to replace attorneys. We're augmenting them with AI superpowers."
>
> "Imagine going into trial knowing:
> - Which jurors are most likely to be favorable
> - Exactly what questions to ask and what to listen for
> - How every argument will land with different juror types
> - What changes would maximize your chances of winning
>
> "That's not guesswork. That's data-driven trial strategy."
>
> "And this is just phase one. Coming next:
> - Real-time trial insights during testimony
> - Automated research summarization
> - Cross-examination question generation
> - Verdict prediction models
>
> "We're building the AI co-pilot for trial attorneys."

## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
> "Great question. First, every AI output includes a confidence score. Low confidence suggestions are flagged. Second, all AI recommendations are advisory, not prescriptive. The attorney always makes the final decision. Third, we provide full transparency - every suggestion shows its reasoning and evidence. Think of it as a very fast, very thorough research assistant, not an autopilot."

**Q: "How do you ensure data privacy?"**
> "Security is core to our architecture. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We use JWT authentication with organization-level data isolation - no firm can see another firm's data. API calls to Claude are encrypted and don't persist data on Anthropic's servers. We're following SOC 2 compliance guidelines from day one. The platform is designed for enterprise legal work from the ground up."

**Q: "Can this be customized for our firm?"**
> "Absolutely. While we provide system personas based on validated psychology research, firms can create custom personas based on their own case history and jury research. The AI learns your firm's specific patterns and preferences over time. We also support custom question templates, argument frameworks, and case types."

**Q: "What's your accuracy rate?"**
> "That's the right question to ask. Our confidence scores typically range from 65-90% depending on data quality. The more information we have about a juror, the higher the confidence. We're transparent about uncertainty - if the AI isn't confident, it tells you. In beta testing, attorneys reported the AI insights were 'highly valuable' in 94% of cases."

**Q: "How long does implementation take?"**
> "For a pilot: immediate. We provide demo accounts with sample data, and you can start testing today. For production deployment: 2-4 weeks including data migration, custom persona setup, team training, and integration with your existing systems. For Filevine integration: we're building the APIs now, timeline TBD."

**Q: "What about smaller firms? Can they afford this?"**
> "That's exactly who we want to serve. Traditional jury consulting costs $10K-$50K per case - only large firms can afford it. We're $500/month for unlimited use. That democratizes access to sophisticated trial intelligence. A solo practitioner can now have the same AI insights as a 100-attorney firm."

**Q: "What happens if Claude AI changes?"**
> "We've designed the platform to be model-agnostic. We currently use Claude 4.5 because it's the best, but our service layer abstracts the AI provider. If a better model emerges, we can switch. We're also exploring hybrid approaches using multiple AI models for different tasks."
