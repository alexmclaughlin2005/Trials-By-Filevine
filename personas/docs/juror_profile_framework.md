# Juror Profile Framework for Voir Dire and Simulation

## Overview

This framework establishes a systematic approach to juror profiling based on empirical research in jury psychology. It serves three purposes:

1. **Identification**: Surface juror types during voir dire through strategic questioning
2. **Selection/Exclusion**: Guide peremptory challenges and cause challenge strategies
3. **Simulation**: Enable modeling of how different juror types process case facts and deliberate

## Part 1: Core Dimensions of Juror Psychology

### Dimension 1: Attribution Orientation
**Definition**: How a person explains the causes of events—dispositional (personal traits/choices) vs. situational (circumstances/systems)

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Strong Dispositional | "People are responsible for what happens to them" |
| 2 | Moderate Dispositional | Leans toward personal responsibility but acknowledges some circumstances |
| 3 | Balanced | Weighs both factors depending on evidence |
| 4 | Moderate Situational | Recognizes systemic factors, but still values individual agency |
| 5 | Strong Situational | "Circumstances and systems largely determine outcomes" |

**Plaintiff preference**: 4-5 (will attribute injury to defendant's circumstances/negligence)
**Defense preference**: 1-2 (will scrutinize plaintiff's choices)

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "When someone gets hurt at work, what's usually the main cause—the person not being careful enough, or the workplace not being safe enough?"
- "If a driver hits a pedestrian, do you tend to think first about what the driver did wrong, or what the pedestrian might have done differently?"
- "Tell me about a time something bad happened to you or someone close to you. Looking back, was it mostly about choices made or circumstances beyond control?"

---

### Dimension 2: Just World Belief (JWB)
**Definition**: The degree to which a person believes the world is fundamentally fair—that people get what they deserve

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Low JWB | "Bad things happen to good people randomly; life isn't fair" |
| 2 | Moderate-Low JWB | Recognizes unfairness but believes in some cosmic balance |
| 3 | Moderate JWB | Situationally dependent beliefs about fairness |
| 4 | Moderate-High JWB | Generally believes hard work is rewarded, bad behavior punished |
| 5 | High JWB | "People largely get what they deserve in life" |

**JWB Subtypes** (critical distinction):
- **JWB-Self**: Believes the world is fair *to them personally* → More moderate, will reduce damages for contributory fault but won't deny compensation entirely
- **JWB-Others**: Believes the world is equally fair *to everyone* → Most likely to blame victims
- **Immanent Justice**: Believes outcomes are *inherently deserved* → Strongest victim-blaming tendency

**Plaintiff preference**: 1-2 (won't need to blame victim to maintain worldview)
**Defense preference**: 4-5 (especially JWB-Others subtype)

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "Some people believe that, generally speaking, people get what they deserve in life. On a scale of 1-10, how much do you agree?"
- "When you hear about someone having a run of bad luck, do you tend to wonder what they did to bring it on themselves?"
- "Do you believe that if someone works hard and makes good decisions, they'll usually end up okay?"
- "Have you ever seen a truly good person suffer something terrible through no fault of their own? How did you make sense of that?"

---

### Dimension 3: Authoritarianism
**Definition**: Preference for order, rule-following, conventional authority, and clear hierarchies

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Low Authoritarian | Values individual judgment, questions authority, tolerates ambiguity |
| 2 | Moderate-Low | Generally independent but respects legitimate expertise |
| 3 | Moderate | Situationally defers to authority |
| 4 | Moderate-High | Strong respect for rules, hierarchy, and conventional authority |
| 5 | High Authoritarian | Rigid rule-following, deference to authority, intolerance of deviance |

**Case-specific implications**:
- **Criminal defense**: High authoritarians convict 35% more often, recommend 2x longer sentences
- **Personal injury plaintiff**: Mixed—may follow safety rules strictly (good for plaintiff) but also defer to corporate authority (bad)
- **Personal injury defense**: Generally favorable—respects institutional defendants, skeptical of those who "break rules" (injured plaintiffs who didn't follow protocol)

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "How important is it to you that people follow rules, even when the rules seem inconvenient?"
- "When an expert or authority figure gives an opinion, how much weight does that carry with you?"
- "Some people think rules should be followed strictly; others think it depends on the situation. Where do you fall?"
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a rule or policy. What did you do?"

---

### Dimension 4: Institutional Trust
**Definition**: Level of trust/skepticism toward corporations, government, legal system, medical establishment

| Entity | Low Trust Indicators | High Trust Indicators |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Corporations** | "Profit over people" | "Job creators, generally responsible" |
| **Legal System** | "Rigged for the powerful" | "Generally fair and just" |
| **Medical Establishment** | "Covers up mistakes" | "Professionals doing their best" |
| **Insurance Companies** | "Will do anything to avoid paying" | "Legitimate business managing risk" |

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "When a large corporation says something publicly, how much do you tend to believe it?"
- "Do you think most medical malpractice lawsuits are legitimate or frivolous?"
- "Have you or anyone close to you had a negative experience with an insurance company? Tell me about it."
- "Some people think corporations generally try to do the right thing; others think they prioritize profits over everything. Where do you fall?"

---

### Dimension 5: Litigation Attitude
**Definition**: General orientation toward lawsuits, damage awards, and the civil justice system

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Strong Anti-Litigation | "Lawsuit lottery," "Jackpot justice," awards are excessive |
| 2 | Moderate Anti-Litigation | Skeptical of lawsuits but acknowledges some are legitimate |
| 3 | Neutral | Evaluates case-by-case |
| 4 | Moderate Pro-Litigation | Sees lawsuits as important accountability mechanism |
| 5 | Strong Pro-Litigation | Views civil justice system as essential protection for individuals |

**Research finding**: Belief that lawsuits/awards are NOT excessive correlates with 24-26% higher likelihood of plaintiff verdict

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "When you hear someone filed a personal injury lawsuit, what's your gut reaction?"
- "Do you think jury awards in personal injury cases are generally too high, about right, or too low?"
- "Is there any amount of money that you just wouldn't award for pain and suffering, regardless of evidence?"
- "Some people think there are too many lawsuits in America. On a scale of 0-100, where do you fall?"

---

### Dimension 6: Leadership/Influence Tendency
**Definition**: Likelihood of emerging as an opinion leader, foreperson, or influential voice in deliberation

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Strong Follower | Defers to others, avoids conflict, easily swayed |
| 2 | Moderate Follower | Participates but doesn't drive discussion |
| 3 | Engaged Participant | Contributes actively, neither leads nor follows exclusively |
| 4 | Moderate Leader | Often shapes discussion, persuades others |
| 5 | Strong Leader | Dominates deliberation, likely foreperson candidate |

**Research findings on forepersons**:
- Account for 25-31% of speaking time
- Correlation between their pre-deliberation verdict preference and final verdict is 2x that of other jurors
- Selected within first 4 minutes in 2/3 of juries
- Predictors: speaks first, sits at head of table, suggests leader selection, higher education, professional status, age 45-65, male, extraverted

**Strategic implications**:
- If you have favorable leaders → want them seated and positioned to lead
- If unfavorable leaders → strike or position unfavorably
- Identify followers who might support your favorable leaders

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "In group projects at work or elsewhere, what role do you usually play?"
- "When a group disagrees, do you tend to speak up first or wait to see what others think?"
- "Have you served as a team leader, supervisor, or in another leadership role? How was that experience?"
- **Observe**: Who speaks first in group questioning? Who makes eye contact? Who sits prominently?

---

### Dimension 7: Cognitive Processing Style
**Definition**: How a person naturally processes information—narrative/holistic vs. analytical/systematic

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Strong Narrative | Thinks in stories, focuses on people and motives, emotional resonance |
| 2 | Moderate Narrative | Prefers stories but can engage with data |
| 3 | Balanced | Adapts to information type |
| 4 | Moderate Analytical | Prefers data and logic but responds to compelling narratives |
| 5 | Strong Analytical | Focuses on facts, numbers, logical consistency; skeptical of emotional appeals |

**Strategic implications**:
- Narrative processors respond to Story Model presentation (chronological, character-driven)
- Analytical processors want evidence-first, systematic presentation
- Mixed juries require both approaches
- Plaintiff cases often benefit from narrative processors (sympathy, human impact)
- Defense cases often benefit from analytical processors (technical defenses, causation gaps)

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "When you read the news, do you prefer human interest stories or data-driven analysis?"
- "When making a big decision, do you go more with your gut or do a detailed pros/cons analysis?"
- "What kind of books or shows do you enjoy? What draws you to them?"

---

### Dimension 8: Damages Orientation
**Definition**: Specific attitudes toward monetary compensation for non-economic damages

| Aspect | Conservative | Liberal |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Pain & Suffering** | Skeptical of large awards for intangibles | Values compensation for human experience |
| **Punitive Damages** | Only for egregious conduct | Important deterrent mechanism |
| **Anchoring Susceptibility** | Moderately high demands work best | Lower anchoring resistance |
| **Per Diem Acceptance** | Often skeptical | Often receptive |

**Surfacing Questions**:
- "How do you feel about putting a dollar amount on someone's pain or emotional suffering?"
- "Is there a number that would just seem too high to you, no matter what?"
- "What do you think the purpose of a damage award should be—to compensate the injured person, punish the wrongdoer, or something else?"

---

## Part 2: Composite Juror Archetypes

Based on dimensional intersections, we can identify recurring juror profiles. Each archetype includes:
- Dimensional profile
- Behavioral indicators
- Voir dire detection questions
- Favorability assessment (plaintiff vs. defense, by case type)
- Cause challenge vulnerability
- Simulation parameters

---

### Archetype 1: "The Personal Responsibility Enforcer"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Attribution: Strong Dispositional (1-2)
- JWB: High (4-5), often JWB-Others subtype
- Authoritarianism: High (4-5)
- Institutional Trust: High (corporations, medical)
- Litigation Attitude: Anti-litigation (1-2)
- Leadership: Variable
- Processing: Often analytical

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Uses phrases like "people need to take responsibility," "play stupid games, win stupid prizes"
- References to "lawsuit abuse," "coffee at McDonald's case"
- Mentions personal examples of not suing when they could have
- Conservative political indicators (though not always explicit)

**Detection Questions**:
- "If someone slips and falls in a store, what's usually the main cause?"
- "Have you ever thought about suing someone but decided not to? Why?"
- "What do you think about people who sue their doctors?"

**Favorability**:
- **Personal injury plaintiff**: HIGHLY UNFAVORABLE - will scrutinize plaintiff conduct, minimize damages, skeptical of non-economic damages
- **Personal injury defense**: FAVORABLE - natural ally
- **Medical malpractice plaintiff**: VERY UNFAVORABLE - trusts medical establishment
- **Criminal prosecution**: FAVORABLE - tough on defendants

**Cause Challenge Strategy**:
Focus on inability to award full damages:
- "You mentioned you're skeptical of large awards. Is there an amount you just couldn't award regardless of evidence?"
- "Would it be fair to say that someone bringing this type of lawsuit starts with a strike against them in your mind?"
- "Given your beliefs about personal responsibility, would it be difficult to find in favor of someone who admits they weren't paying full attention?"

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "liability_threshold": 0.7,  // Requires strong evidence for plaintiff liability finding
  "contributory_fault_weight": 2.0,  // Heavily weighs any plaintiff contribution
  "damage_multiplier": 0.5,  // Awards at ~50% of requested
  "non_economic_skepticism": 0.8,  // Highly skeptical of pain/suffering
  "deliberation_stance": "defense_advocate",
  "persuadability": 0.3  // Difficult to move from initial position
}
```

---

### Archetype 2: "The Systemic Thinker"

- Academic, social work, non-profit, or public sector employment common
- Progressive political indicators

**Detection Questions**:
- "When large corporations get sued, do you think they usually deserve it or is it usually overblown?"
- "Do you think the legal system treats individuals and corporations fairly?"
- "Have you ever been in a situation where you felt a company or institution put profits ahead of safety?"

**Favorability**:
- **Personal injury plaintiff vs. corporation**: HIGHLY FAVORABLE
- **Personal injury defense**: UNFAVORABLE
- **Criminal defense**: Often FAVORABLE (skeptical of prosecution/police)
- **Individual vs. individual**: More neutral

**Cause Challenge Strategy** (for defense):
Focus on presumption of corporate guilt:
- "You mentioned corporations often prioritize profits. Would it be difficult to give [Corporate Defendant] a fair shake?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how hard would it be for you to believe that [Corporation] acted responsibly here?"
- "Can you think of a situation where a corporation did the right thing and still got sued unfairly?"

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "liability_threshold": 0.4,  // Lower evidence threshold for corporate defendant
  "contributory_fault_weight": 0.5,  // Minimizes plaintiff contribution
  "damage_multiplier": 1.5,  // Awards at ~150% of anchored amount
  "non_economic_acceptance": 0.8,  // Receptive to pain/suffering arguments
  "punitive_inclination": 0.7,  // Will consider punitive damages

### Archetype 3: "The Fair-Minded Evaluator"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Attribution: Balanced (3)
- JWB: Moderate (2-3)
- Authoritarianism: Moderate-Low (2-3)
- Institutional Trust: Moderate (entity-dependent)
- Litigation Attitude: Neutral (3)
- Leadership: Engaged Participant (3-4)
- Processing: Balanced

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Uses qualifying language: "it depends," "I'd need to see the evidence"
- Asks clarifying questions during voir dire
- Mentions wanting to "hear both sides"
- Professional background often involves evaluation: managers, teachers, analysts
- Politically moderate or non-ideological

**Detection Questions**:
- "What would you need to see to decide this case?"
- "Do you tend to form opinions quickly or prefer to wait until you have all the information?"
- "In disputes between individuals and companies, do you have a natural lean either way?"

**Favorability**:
- **Both sides**: NEUTRAL - genuinely persuadable
- Actually decides based on evidence presented
- **Key insight**: These jurors are valuable swing votes; the side with the better story/evidence wins them

**Cause Challenge Strategy**:
Generally NOT a cause challenge target - too balanced. Save strikes for more extreme profiles.

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "liability_threshold": 0.5,  // Standard preponderance threshold
  "contributory_fault_weight": 1.0,  // Weighs proportionally
  "damage_multiplier": 1.0,  // Awards near anchored amount if liability found
  "evidence_weight": 1.5,  // Highly responsive to evidence quality
  "deliberation_stance": "neutral_evaluator",
  "persuadability": 0.7  // Open to persuasion from both sides
}
```

---

### Archetype 4: "The Authoritative Leader"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Leadership: Strong (5)
- Authoritarianism: Variable
- Processing: Often analytical
- Other dimensions: Variable

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Speaks first, speaks often during group voir dire
- Makes eye contact with attorney, sits prominently
- Professional leadership roles: executives, managers, military officers
- Confident demeanor, assertive communication style
- May subtly position self as spokesperson for other jurors

**Detection Questions**:
- **Primarily observational during voir dire**
- "What do you do for work? Do you manage others?"
- "When your team disagrees, how do you typically handle it?"
- "Have you ever served on a jury before? What role did you play in deliberations?"

**Favorability**:
- Depends entirely on their OTHER dimensional profile
- A "Personal Responsibility Enforcer" who is also an "Authoritative Leader" is extremely dangerous for plaintiffs
- A "Systemic Thinker" who is also an "Authoritative Leader" is extremely valuable for plaintiffs

**Strategic Implications**:
- Identify leaders early and assess their other traits
- If favorable leader: seat them, position for influence
- If unfavorable leader: must strike - they will dominate deliberation

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "influence_weight": 2.5,  // Their votes count 2.5x in deliberation simulation
  "speaking_time_share": 0.28,  // ~28% of deliberation time
  "persuasion_effectiveness": 1.8,  // Strong ability to move others
  "position_stability": 0.8  // Difficult to move from their position
}
```

---

### Archetype 5: "The Compliant Follower"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Leadership: Strong Follower (1-2)
- Authoritarianism: Often High (defers to authority)
- Processing: Often narrative
- Other dimensions: Variable but susceptible to group influence

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Avoids eye contact, speaks quietly
- Agrees easily with statements from attorneys or other jurors
- Uses phrases like "I guess so," "whatever the group decides"

**Detection Questions**:
- "When you disagree with a group, what do you usually do?"
- "On a team, do you tend to go along with the majority or voice your own opinion?"
- Observe: Do they look at other jurors before answering? Do they change answers when contradicted?

**Favorability**:
- Depends on jury composition - will follow strongest voices
- Valuable if your favorable leaders are seated
- Risky if opposing favorable leaders dominate

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "influence_weight": 0.5,  // Their independent views count less
  "social_pressure_susceptibility": 0.9,  // Highly susceptible to majority
  "position_stability": 0.2,  // Will shift with group pressure
  "deliberation_role": "majority_follower"
}
```

---

### Archetype 6: "The Wounded Veteran"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Personal experience: Significant negative experience relevant to case type
- JWB: Often Low (1-2) due to personal injustice
- Institutional Trust: Low toward entity type that wronged them
- Litigation Attitude: Variable
- Processing: Strong narrative (interprets through personal lens)

**Subtypes**:
- **Wronged Patient**: Medical malpractice victim → Favorable plaintiff in med mal
- **Injured Worker**: Workplace injury → Favorable plaintiff in workplace cases
- **Lawsuit Defendant**: Been sued before → Often favorable defense
- **Uncompensated Victim**: Had injury, didn't sue or got nothing → HIGHLY VARIABLE

**Critical Note on "Uncompensated Victim"**:
Research shows this can go either way:
- Some think: "I suffered and got nothing, why should they get money?"
- Others think: "I wish I had done what this plaintiff is doing"
Must probe deeply to determine orientation.

**Detection Questions**:
- "Have you or anyone close to you ever been seriously injured? Tell me about that."
- "Has anyone close to you ever been involved in a lawsuit—either side?"
- "If you could go back, would you have handled that situation differently?"

**Cause Challenge Strategy** (if unfavorable):
- "You mentioned your own injury experience. Would it be difficult to set that aside?"
- "Given what happened to you, would you hold this plaintiff to the same standard you held yourself?"

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "experiential_anchor": true,  // Processes case through personal experience lens
  "analogical_reasoning_weight": 2.0,  // Heavily weighs similarity to own experience
  "emotional_engagement": 0.8,  // High emotional involvement
  // Other parameters depend on experience outcome
}
```

---

### Archetype 7: "The Numbers Person"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Processing: Strong Analytical (5)
- Leadership: Often Moderate-High (speaks with data authority)
- Other dimensions: Variable

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- STEM, finance, accounting, engineering backgrounds
- Asks about statistics, causation standards, burden of proof
- May express frustration with "subjective" concepts like pain/suffering
- Wants clear, logical frameworks

**Detection Questions**:
- "What do you do for work? Does it involve a lot of data analysis?"
- "When you hear about a study or statistic, what's the first thing you think about?"
- "How comfortable are you putting a number on something that's hard to measure, like pain?"

**Favorability**:
- **Causation-heavy cases**: Can be favorable to either side depending on evidence
- **Damages phase**: Often UNFAVORABLE to plaintiffs (skeptical of non-economic damages)
- **Technical defense cases**: Often favorable to defense

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "narrative_discount": 0.5,  // Less moved by stories
  "data_weight": 2.0,  // Heavily influenced by statistics, expert testimony
  "causation_threshold": 0.7,  // Requires strong causal evidence
  "non_economic_skepticism": 0.7,  // Skeptical of intangible damages
  "deliberation_role": "evidence_analyzer"
}
```

---

### Archetype 8: "The Empathic Connector"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Processing: Strong Narrative (1-2)
- Attribution: Often Moderate-Situational (3-4)
- JWB: Low-Moderate (1-3)
- Leadership: Variable

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- Healthcare, education, social work, counseling backgrounds
- References emotional impact, human stories
- Asks about the plaintiff/defendant as a person
- Shows visible emotional reaction during voir dire
- Uses feeling language: "That must have been terrible"

**Detection Questions**:
- "When you hear about someone being injured, what's the first thing you think about?"
- "How do you think an injury like this would affect someone's daily life?"
- "What draws you to your work in [caregiving field]?"

**Favorability**:
- **Personal injury plaintiff**: FAVORABLE - resonates with human impact
- **Medical malpractice plaintiff**: FAVORABLE
- **Defense in sympathetic plaintiff cases**: UNFAVORABLE

**Cause Challenge Strategy** (for defense):
- "You seem like a very empathetic person. Would it be difficult to set aside sympathy and focus only on what the evidence shows?"
- "If you felt sorry for someone but the evidence didn't support their case, could you return a defense verdict?"

**Simulation Parameters**:
```
{
  "narrative_weight": 2.0,  // Heavily influenced by story presentation
  "emotional_engagement": 0.9,  // High emotional involvement
  "sympathy_factor": 1.5,  // Sympathy increases plaintiff damages
  "non_economic_acceptance": 0.9,  // Very receptive to pain/suffering

---

### Archetype 9: "The Stealth Juror"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Hidden agenda or strong bias concealed during voir dire

**Warning Signs**:
- Answers are "too perfect" - says exactly what attorneys want to hear
- Inconsistencies between questionnaire and oral voir dire
- Unusual interest in being selected
- Background suggests strong bias not reflected in answers
- Social media/background check reveals hidden positions

**Detection Strategies**:
- Compare written questionnaire to oral answers
- Ask same question differently multiple times
- Use scaled questions that force gradation (can't just say "fair")
- Background research on social media, litigation history
- Ask: "What have you read or heard about this case?"

**Cause Challenge Strategy**:
- Document inconsistencies: "On your questionnaire you said X, but just now you said Y. Can you help me understand?"
- "Have you ever posted anything online about [case topic]?"

---

### Archetype 10: "The Nullifier"

**Dimensional Profile**:
- Strong personal beliefs that override legal instructions
- May believe certain laws/rules are unjust
- Authoritarianism: Very Low (1)
- Processing: Principle-based rather than evidence-based

**Subtypes**:
- **Pro-plaintiff nullifier**: Believes corporations should always pay
- **Pro-defense nullifier**: Believes lawsuits are inherently illegitimate
- **Moral nullifier**: Will decide based on moral judgment regardless of law

**Warning Signs**:
- Statements suggesting law doesn't apply to their judgment
- History of activism or strong stated principles
- Resistance to following jury instructions
- "I'll do what's right regardless"

**Detection Questions**:
- "If the judge instructs you to apply a law you disagree with, could you follow that instruction?"
- "Is there any circumstance where you think a jury should ignore the law to reach a fair result?"

### Cause Challenge Script Templates

**For Personal Responsibility Enforcer** (plaintiff challenging):
```
1. SURFACE: "You mentioned people should take responsibility for themselves. On a scale of 1-10, how strongly do you feel about that?"
2. NORMALIZE: "A lot of people feel that way. It's a totally reasonable position."
3. APPLY: "Given those beliefs, would it be fair to say someone filing a lawsuit like this starts behind in your mind?"
4. LOCK: "And that's your honest view—nothing I could say would change that life experience?"
5. COMMITMENT: "Would it be fair to say it would be very difficult for you to award someone money for something they might have been able to prevent?"
```

**For Systemic Thinker** (defense challenging):
```
1. SURFACE: "You mentioned corporations sometimes prioritize profits. Can you tell me more about that?"
2. NORMALIZE: "Many people share that concern."
3. APPLY: "Would it be difficult to give [Corporation] a fair hearing given those feelings?"
4. LOCK: "On a scale of 1-10, where 10 is 'impossible,' how hard would it be to find [Corporation] not liable if the evidence supported it?"
5. COMMITMENT: "Would you agree that [Corporation] doesn't start this trial with a clean slate in your mind?"
```

## Part 5: Implementation Notes

### Data Collection for Model Training

To build predictive models, collect:
1. Pre-voir dire questionnaire responses (standardized)
2. Oral voir dire answers (transcribed/coded)
3. Demographic data
4. Observable behavioral markers
5. Verdict and deliberation data (where available)
6. Post-trial juror interviews

### Suggested Voir Dire Questionnaire Items

```
ATTRIBUTION SCALE (validated items):
- "When someone fails at something, it's usually because of their own mistakes." (1-7)
- "Success in life is mostly determined by circumstances outside our control." (1-7)
- "People who work hard usually get what they deserve." (1-7)

JUST WORLD SCALE (Lerner adapted):
- "I feel that the world treats people fairly." (1-7)
- "I believe that people get what they deserve." (1-7)
- "When bad things happen to people, they often brought it on themselves." (1-7)

LITIGATION ATTITUDE SCALE:
- "There are too many lawsuits in America today." (1-7)
- "Jury awards for injuries are often excessive." (1-7)
- "Lawsuits are an important way to hold wrongdoers accountable." (1-7)

INSTITUTIONAL TRUST:
- "Large corporations generally act responsibly." (1-7)
- "The medical system does a good job protecting patients." (1-7)
- "Insurance companies treat policyholders fairly." (1-7)
```

### Integration with Jury Selection Software

This framework can be implemented as:
1. Questionnaire scoring algorithm
2. Real-time voir dire analysis tool
3. Jury composition optimizer
4. Deliberation outcome simulator
