## Premises Liability (Slip and Fall)

### Case Profile
Plaintiff: Customer who slipped on wet floor in grocery store
Defendant: National grocery chain
Allegation: No wet floor signs, inadequate inspection procedures

### Archetype Reactions

| Archetype | Liability Stance | Damages Stance | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Bootstrapper | 15% | Very Low | "Watch where you're walking" |
| Crusader | 60% | Moderate-High | "Company should maintain safe premises" |
| Scale-Balancer | 45% | Based on evidence | "What were the inspection logs?" |
| Heart | 55% | Moderate | "They were hurt, but was it preventable?" |
| Calculator | 40% | Low-Moderate | "What's industry standard for inspections?" |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Plaintiff was looking at phone while walking"**
- Bootstrapper: "Case closed"
- Crusader: "Store should still have had signs up"
- Scale-Balancer: "Comparative negligence applies"

**"Store hadn't inspected aisle in 45 minutes"**
- Bootstrapper: "Is that really unreasonable?"
- Crusader: "Standard is every 30 minutes"
- Calculator: "What's the industry benchmark?"

### Note: Slip-and-fall cases are difficult
Most archetypes are skeptical of slip-and-fall cases. Even Crusaders don't feel the same urgency as corporate malfeasance cases. Plaintiff needs very clean facts (no phone, no contributory issues, clear notice failure).

| Calculator | 45% | Calculated | "What was the statistical probability of different diagnosis?" |
| Scarred (medical) | 85%+ | Very High | "I've seen doctors cover up mistakes" |

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Patient didn't mention family history of cancer"**
- Bootstrapper: "Doctor can't read minds"
- Crusader: "Doctor should have asked"
- Calculator: "What's the protocol for family history?"

**"Survival rate would have been 80% with early detection vs. 20%"**
- All archetypes: This is compelling evidence
- Calculator: "Loss of chance doctrine applies?"

**"Doctor sees 40 patients per day"**
- Bootstrapper: "Doctors are overworked; patients need to advocate for themselves"
- Crusader: "Hospital's fault for understaffing"

### Key Evidence Reactions

**"Internal memo: 'Battery defect rate within acceptable parameters'"**
- Bootstrapper: "They made a business decision"
- Crusader: "They calculated people getting hurt was acceptable"
- Calculator: "What was their definition of 'acceptable'?"

**"User was using third-party charger"**
- Bootstrapper: "User error"
- Crusader: "Battery shouldn't explode regardless of charger"
- Scale-Balancer: "How much does that contribute to defect?"

### Special Note: Punitive Damages
